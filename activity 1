1. The internet connects computers globally. The web is a part of it where we access websites.
2. Client asks for data (like browsers). Server gives the data (like web hosts).
3. You type a URL → DNS finds IP → request sent → server responds → website loads.
4. URL has: protocol (http), domain (site name), path (/page), and query (?id=1).
5. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses so computers can connect.
6. A computer can browse (client) and run a local server (like XAMPP) at the same time.
7. Client sends a request → server processes → sends back a response.
8. Front-end = design, Back-end = logic, Full-stack = both, DevOps = server setup.
9a. Library = tools you use. Framework = structure you follow.
9b. Client = user device. Client-side = code running in browser.
9c. Server = machine. Server-side = code running on server.
10a. URL – web address
10b. IP – device ID
10c. Localhost – your computer
10d. Port – service channel
10e. DNS – matches names to IPs
11. As a BSIT student, web skills help in building systems, apps, and sites used in real-world projects.

✅ Activity 2 – Numbers and Arithmetic (Short Version)

A.

-5 → Integer

0.75 → Decimal

3/5 → Fraction

8² → Exponent

B.

8 + 3 × 4 - 2 = 18

(6 + 2) × 5 = 40

(1/2 + 1/4)² = (3/4)² = 9/16

(-3 + 5)² × (-2) = 4 × -2 = -8

C.
29 % 6 = 5

D.
₱45 ÷ ₱12 = 3 tickets (₱36), ₱45 % ₱12 = ₱9 left
